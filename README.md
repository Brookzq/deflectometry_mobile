# ðŸ“¸ Android Camera2 Secret Picture Taker (AC2SPT) 

Take pictures secretly (without preview or launching device's camera app) from all available cameras using Android CAMERA2 API.
The <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/package-summary.html">Camera2 API</a> replaces the deprecated Camera class.

## Usage

1. Implement the interface <a href="https://github.com/hzitoun/android-camera2-secret-picture-taker/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/hzitoun/camera2SecretPictureTaker/listeners/PictureCapturingListener.java">```PictureCapturingListener```</a> (your capture listener) and override the following methods:
    -  **void onDoneCapturingAllPhotos(TreeMap<String, byte[]> picturesTaken)** which is called when we've done taking pictures from ALL available cameras OR when NO camera was detected on the device;
    -  **void onCaptureDone(String pictureUrl, byte[] pictureData)** to get a couple (picture Url, picture Data). Use this method if you don't want to wait for ALL pictures to be ready;
2. Create a new instance of <a href="https://github.com/hzitoun/android-camera2-secret-picture-taker/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/hzitoun/camera2SecretPictureTaker/services/APictureCapturingService.java">```APictureCapturingService``` </a> using <a href="https://github.com/hzitoun/android-camera2-secret-picture-taker/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/hzitoun/camera2SecretPictureTaker/services/PictureCapturingServiceImpl.java">```PictureCapturingServiceImpl#getInstance()```</a> method;
3. **Start capture** by calling the method ```APictureCapturingService#startCapturing(PictureCapturingListener listener) ``` and pass the listener you've just implemented (**step 1**)

## Sample

Here, I've chosen to just  display the two pictures taken within a vertical linear layout. Here is a code snippet of how to use the service:

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements PictureCapturingListener, ActivityCompat.OnRequestPermissionsResultCallback {
     private APictureCapturingService pictureService;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        //check for camera and external storage permissions
        checkPermissions();
        final Button btn = (Button) findViewById(R.id.startCaptureBtn);
        pictureService = PictureCapturingServiceImpl.getInstance(this);
        //start capturing when clicking on the button
        btn.setOnClickListener(v ->
                pictureService.startCapturing(this)
        );
    }

    @Override
    public void onDoneCapturingAllPhotos(TreeMap<String, byte[]> picturesTaken) {
        if (picturesTaken != null && !picturesTaken.isEmpty()) {
            picturesTaken.forEach((pictureUrl, pictureData) -> {
               //convert the byte array 'pictureData' to a bitmap (no need to read the file from the external storage) but in case you
               //You can also use 'pictureUrl' which stores the picture's location on the device
                final Bitmap bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeByteArray(pictureData, 0, pictureData.length);
            });
            showToast("Done capturing all photos!");
            return;
        }
        showToast("No camera detected!");
    }

    @Override
    public void onCaptureDone(String pictureUrl, byte[] pictureData) {
        if (pictureData != null && pictureUrl != null) {
            runOnUiThread(() -> {
                //convert byte array 'pictureData' to a bitmap (no need to read the file from the external storage)
                final Bitmap bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeByteArray(pictureData, 0, pictureData.length);
                //scale image to avoid POTENTIAL "Bitmap too large to be uploaded into a texture" when displaying into an ImageView
                final int nh = (int) (bitmap.getHeight() * (512.0 / bitmap.getWidth()));
                final Bitmap scaled = Bitmap.createScaledBitmap(bitmap, 512, nh, true);
               //do whatever you want with the bitmap or the scaled one...
            });
            showToast("Picture saved to " + pictureUrl);
        }
    }
    
    private void showToast(final String text) {
        runOnUiThread(() ->
                Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), text, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
        );
    }

}
```
